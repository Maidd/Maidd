# eepiest woman in the world  
I usually do whatever interests me at the time (so usually gacha game reverse engineering, wherever my ADHD takes me).  
I usually prefer working with Rust and Python (for anything one-off script)  
###### (Go/C#/TypeScript also works but the above are my main preferences)  

Currently pursuing a Computer Science degree.
